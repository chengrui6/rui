Interesting question



Do you know how many heart beats a day?

A normal person's heart rate fluctuates between 60-100 times/min when he is resting quietly. If calculated according to this, the human heart rate is about 80-120,000 times/day. If you are sympathetic or have movement, excitement, the heart rate can exceed 100 times/minute, so the heart rate throughout the day may exceed 120,000 times. If it is an athlete, a laborer who is physically active, his heart rate can also be less than 60 beats per minute, but most of them are more than 50 beats per minute, and throughout the day it can be less than 80,000 beats, but generally it is more than 70,000 beats.
